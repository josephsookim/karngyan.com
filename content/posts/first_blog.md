This blog post will be the first of many. I would say it's the start of something great to come...

<!--more-->

## A few points I'd like to highlight are:

- I will be using these blogs to talk about my learning experiences (ex: what i learned that day/week).
- Additionally, anything that got me thinking in the day is subject to be written about in my blogs (ex: life)

## My Goals:

- Many years from now, I want to look back at my blog posts and see how much I have grown on a day to day basis.
- Hopefully, I can be proud of not only my personal growth, but my career growth as well.
