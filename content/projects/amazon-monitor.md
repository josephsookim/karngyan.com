## Brief Summary

- Developed a high-impact bot using Amazon’s Product Advertising API, hosted on Google Cloud Linux Virtual Machines, to tackle pandemic-related supply shortages.
- Facilitated timely customer purchases by tracking scarce items, resulting in \$2M+ revenue for Amazon.

## My Inspiration

During the challenging times of the pandemic, I recognized the frustration caused by the scarcity of essential and recreational items due to heightened demand. Anticipating the need for a more efficient solution, I innovated a tool capable of automating the arduous task of monitoring and tracking the availability of hundreds of sought-after products. This endeavor stemmed from my understanding that people shouldn't have to spend endless hours glued to their screens, refreshing online stores in hopes of securing the items they require. With this initiative, I aimed to alleviate the stress of online shopping and facilitate access to essential goods for individuals navigating unprecedented circumstances.

## My Impact

Through strategic outreach, I successfully introduced my bot to over **50 Discord communities**, reaching a combined membership of over **20,000 individuals**. Leveraging my affiliate link with Amazon, I contributed to generating over **\$2 million** in revenue, making this side hustle project immensely profitable. This achievement not only highlights the scalability of my solution but also underscores its significant impact on facilitating access to in-demand products while creating a mutually beneficial partnership with a major online retailer.
